	title = VHF3088T Tunable Low Profile VHF Antenna
	manufacturer = Komrod Communication
	description = The VHF3088T is an affordable high‐gain low‐profile antenna for use on vehicles. The antenna has an equivalent performance to a 3.5 m whip although less than a third of the height. The antenna has been designed to resolve all the problems associated with long whips on vehicles such as breakages, interference with high voltage lines or the need to be tied down when travelling at speed. The antenna is a direct replacement for existing VHF whip antennas and uses the same NATO base support. The very high performance of the antenna over the complete 30 to 88 MHz range is obtained through the use of low loss PIN diode switching of a low‐loss radiating system. An excellent VSWR is assured through the use of a digitally controlled automatic control circuit. The antenna tuning time is less than 60 µs and so can be used with all modern tac‐tical VHF radios
