          KSP Secondary Motion
========================================
A Kerbals Space Program MOD by Icecovery

KSP Secondary Motion adds secondary physics motion to some stock antennas and solar panels, it also added some brand new parts to the game.
This mod is still working in progress, the APIs are subject to change.

Features:
Wobbling antennas and solar panels
Real-world used ground antennas
CREW Duke Anti-IED system (BDArmory support, works as a jammer)
TweakScale support
A plunger
Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Flailing Tubemen
Pickle Rick!

How to Use:
Generally, there is no need for the user to adjust settings, but if you don’t like the wiggliness of a certain part, you can adjust the Damper Ratio and the Spring Ratio in the right-click menu of that part. 
The current version of the mod also has a Failsafe Activate Range slide bar in the right-click menu, if you find that the part behaves abnormally during the flight (such as flashing), you can increase the value to reduce or eliminate the effect. I am currently trying to fix this behavior, it is related to KSP's Floating Origin and Krakensbane, this option will not in the v1.0 release if the problem is addressed. Help and suggestions for fixing this problem are welcome.

Todo List:
This mod is still working in progress, check the todo list here https://github.com/Icecovery/KSPSecondaryMotion#todo-list

Modding:
If you are a mod creator and looking for adding secondary motion effects to your mod, the documentation is coming soon. It will be simple as adding two additional transforms to your part. The mod even allowed you to reconstruct the existing part hierarchy from a Module Manager script without re-exporting the part from unity (That's how I add the effect to stock parts). Note that the mod is still working in progress, the APIs are subject to change.
